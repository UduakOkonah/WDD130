            Hello, my name is Uduakobong Lawrence Okonah,
             and I am from Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria. 
             I am a final year student at the University of
             Cross River State (UNICROSS), studying Electrical Electronics Engineering. My long-term goal is to become a Telecommunication Software Engineer.
            Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Software Development, a field that excites me and presents numerous opportunities for growth and innovation. In my free time, I enjoy reading novels, listening to music, and cooking delicious meals.
            Thank you for visiting my web page!</p>
